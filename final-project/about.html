    <div id="about-text">
      <p>Hey, I’m Shirley Du, the creator of this website. </p>
      <p>As a cinephile and a movie poster enthusiast, I believe that cinema is one of the most wonderful inventions in our world. The sensory output in films is so amplified that it allows me to immerse myself in a rich tapestry of visual, auditory, and emotional experiences. With each movie I watch, I try to see through the eyes of the characters, to briefly live their joys and sorrows and, for a moment, inhabit their souls. It's as if I've lived many lives. </p>
      <p>Movie posters encapsulate the visual essence of these films and they, too, hold a particular allure for me. I’ve often thought about how marvelous it would be to collect all the exquisite movie posters from around the globe – and that’s why I created this website. My aim is for other movie and poster aficionados to have a platform where they can purely appreciate the art of movie posters and observe how far filmmakers have come on this path over time. </p>
      <p>The selection of movies is based on the 2022 Sight and Sound Greatest Films of All Time poll, and the primary source for the movie information also comes from there, supplemented by details from Wikipedia when needed. The poster images are sourced from Google, including IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes among others. If you have seen any of the movies featured here or if you are particularly fond of any of the posters, please feel free to mark them as “My Favorites” or “Seen Before.”</p>
